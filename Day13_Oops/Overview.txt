Day 13 OVERVIEW - OOP Intro( Class and Object )

Question:   What it is?
Answer:      OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a way to structure code using classes (blueprints) and objects (instances).

Question: Why it’s important ?
Answer:    Makes code reusable, modular, and organized.
                 Helps in real-world modeling (e.g., a Student class can represent thousands of students as objects).

HEADING --> Key concepts:
   class → defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions).
   object → created from a class, has its own data.
    __init__() → constructor, called automatically when an object is created.
